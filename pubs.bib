	abstract = {In order to support the burgeoning field of research into intra- and interpersonal synchrony, we present an open-source software package: multiSyncPy. Multivariate synchrony goes beyond the bivariate case and can be useful for quantifying how groups, teams, and families coordinate their behaviors, or estimating the degree to which multiple modalities from an individual become synchronized. Our package includes state-of-the-art multivariate methods including symbolic entropy, multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis, coherence (with an additional sum-normalized modification), the cluster-phase ‘Rho’ metric, and a statistical test based on the Kuramoto order parameter. We also include functions for two surrogation techniques to compare the observed coordination dynamics with chance levels and a windowing function to examine time-varying coordination for most of the measures. Taken together, our collation and presentation of these methods make the study of interpersonal synchronization and coordination dynamics applicable to larger, more complex and often more ecologically valid study designs. In this work, we summarize the relevant theoretical background and present illustrative practical examples, lessons learned, as well as guidance for the usage of our package – using synthetic as well as empirical data. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of our work and software and outline interesting further directions and perspectives. multiSyncPy is freely available under the LGPL license at: https://github.com/cslab-hub/multiSyncPy, and also available at the Python package index.},

The authors advance a system typology for classifying TCD approaches and their applications for increasing levels of dynamic complexity.BackgroundThere is an increasing focus on how teams adapt their coordination in response to changing and uncertain operational conditions. Understanding coordination is significant because poor coordination is associated with maladaptive responses, whereas adaptive coordination is associated with effective responses. This issue has been met with TCD approaches that handle increasing complexity in the types of TCD teams exhibit.MethodA three-level system typology of TCD approaches for increasing dynamic complexity is provided, with examples of research at each level. For System I TCD, team states converge toward a stable, fixed-point attractor. For System II TCD, team states are periodic, which can appear complex, yet are regular and relatively stable. In System III TCD, teams can exhibit periodic patterns, but those patterns change continuously to maintain effectiveness.ResultsSystem I and System II are applicable to TCD with known or discoverable behavioral attractors that are stationary across mid-to long-range timescales. System III TCD is the most generalizable to dynamic environments with high requirements for adaptive coordination across a range of timescales.ConclusionWe outline current challenges for TCD and next steps in this burgeoning field of research.ApplicationSystem III approaches are becoming widespread, as they are generalizable to time- and/or scale-varying TCD and multimodal analyses. Recommendations for deploying TCD in team settings are provided.},

While there is evidence that face-to-face communication contributes to effective teamwork, methods for understanding the time-varying nature and structure of team communication are limited. In this work, we combine sensor-based social analytics using a Sociometric badge (Rhythm Badge) with two visualization techniques (Dynamic Complexity Heat Maps and Network Visualizations) to advance an intuitive way of understanding the dynamics of team interaction. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide a case study that examines one team’s interaction for a Lost at Sea simulation. We were able to recover transitions in the task and team interaction as well as uncover structural changes in team member communication patterns, which we visualized using networks. Taken together, this work represents an important first step at optimizing team effectiveness by identifying critical transitions in team interactions.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has been used for training purposes in a wide range of industries, including education, healthcare, and defense. VR allows users to train in a safe and controlled digital environment while being immersed and highly engaged in a realistic task. One of its advantages is that VR can be combined with multiple wearable sensing technologies, allowing researchers to study (neuro)physiological and cognitive processes elicited by dynamic environments and adapt these simulations based on such processes. However, the potential of VR combined with neurotechnology to facilitate effective and efficient aviation training has not yet been fully explored. For instance, despite the growing interest in including VR as part of the training programs for military and commercial airlines pilots, it is still unclear what the effectiveness of VR is in short- and long-term training of pilots. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art research in VR applications for aviation training and identifies challenges and future opportunities. We particularly discuss the potential of neurotechnology in objective measurement of training progress and providing real-time feedback during VR flight tasks. Overall, VR combined with neurotechnology for flight training holds promise to optimize individual learning progress.},

	abstract = {High patient emotional arousal during rationale development for in vivo exposure in CBT for panic disorder with agoraphobia might endanger comprehension of the exposure rationale. Since therapists are supposed to coregulate patients’ emotions, this study investigated whether there was evidence of coregulation of vocally encoded emotional arousal, assessed by fundamental frequency (f0), during rationale development. Furthermore, the association of patient f0 stability and therapist coregulation with patients’ perceived rationale plausibility was analyzed. N = 197 therapy videos—used to deduct f0—from a multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluating therapist-guided exposure on CBT outcome were analyzed post hoc. Plausibility of the exposure rationale was assessed by patients after its development. This trial-specific rating aggregates plausibility ratings for every manual component in the development of the exposure rationale and showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .85). Stability in f0 and its coregulation were calculated using cross-lagged Actor–Partner Interdependence Models (APIMs), and APIM dyad estimates were associated with plausibility using linear regression analyses. Analyses indicated a relative stability in emotional arousal within both patients and therapists. Therapists’ f0 had a significant effect on patients in that with therapist covariation, patients’ f0 departed from their equilibrium level, while patients’ f0 had no effect on therapists. Therapists’ f0 covariation was positively associated with rationale plausibility. This study sheds light on interpersonal regulation mechanisms of patients’ and therapists’ emotional arousal during development of the exposure rationale. It suggests that coregulation of patients’ emotional arousal supports patients’ perceived rationale plausibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

These contexts, are characterized be emergent self-organization that implies higher order coordinated patterns occurring over time that are not due to the actions of any particular agents, but rather due to the collective ordering that occurs from the interactions of the agents. Extant research to understand these social coordination dynamics has primarily examined dyadic contexts performing rhythmic tasks. To advance this area of study, we elaborate on attractor dynamics, our ability to depict them visually, and quantitatively model them. Primarily, we combine difference/differential equation modeling with mixture modeling as a way to infer the underlying topological features of the data, which can be described in terms of attractor dynamic patterns. The advantage of this approach is that we are able to quantify the self-organized dynamics that agents exhibit, link these dynamics back to activity from individual agents, and relate it to other variables central to understanding the coordinative functionality of a system’s behavior. We present four examples that differ in the number of variables used to depict the attractor dynamics (1,2,and 6) and range from simulated to non-simulated data sources. We demonstrate that this is a flexible method that advances scientific study of social coordination dynamics in a variety of multi-agent systems.},

For this examination, we specifically modeled simultaneous change in percent complete and estimated duration for a given project as they were included in monthly reports over time. In short, we utilized latent change score mixture modeling to extract the attractor dynamics within the scheduling data. We found three primarily patterns: an attractor at low duration, low percent complete; a saddle that was attractive toward full completion and repelled duration away from five months, and an attractor at full completion and high duration. We replicated these three patterns using multilevel modeling. Then, we examined how task dependencies, in terms of the number of predecessors and successors, affected the probability of exhibiting a given pattern over time. Thus, we offer a flexible method for understanding the patterns that can characterize scheduling dynamics as well as other dynamical systems.

	abstract = {Humans are high-dimensional, complex systems consisting of many components that must coordinate in order to perform even the simplest of activities. Many behavioral studies, especially in the movement sciences, have advanced the notion of soft-assembly to describe how systems with many components coordinate to perform specific functions while also exhibiting the potential to re-structure and then perform other functions as task demands change. Consistent with this notion, within cognitive neuroscience it is increasingly accepted that the brain flexibly coordinates the networks needed cope with changing task demands. However, evaluation of various indices of soft-assembly has so far been absent from neurophysiological research. To begin addressing this gap, we investigated task-related changes in two distinct indices of soft-assembly using the established phenomenon of EEG repetition suppression. In a repetition priming task, we assessed evidence for changes in the correlation dimension and fractal scaling exponents during stimulus-locked event-related potentials, as a function of stimulus onset and familiarity, and relative to spontaneous non-task-related activity. Consistent with predictions derived from soft-assembly, results indicated decreases in dimensionality and increases in fractal scaling exponents from resting to pre-stimulus states and following stimulus onset. However, contrary to predictions, familiarity tended to increase dimensionality estimates. Overall, the findings support the view from soft-assembly that neural dynamics should become increasingly ordered as external task demands increase, and support the broader application of soft-assembly logic in human electrophysiology.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of the give and take between therapist and client(s) is frequently of interest to therapy process researchers. Characterizing the ways that therapists respond to clients and clients respond to therapists can be challenging in therapeutic encounters involving a single therapist and a single client. The complexity of this challenge increases as the number of people involved in a therapeutic encounter increases not only because there are more people responding to one another but also because the patterns of responding can become more complex. This manuscript demonstrates how dyadic cross-lagged panel models can be extended to psychotherapeutic encounters involving 3 people and used to test processes that exist between dyadic subsets of the larger group as well as the group as one cohesive unit. Three hundred seventy-nine talk turns of fundamental frequency from a couple therapy session were modeled using 3 dyadic cross-lagged panel models, and each individual’s respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was treated as a moderator. Although the regression coefficients for each dyadic subset (e.g., therapist–husband) were nonsignificant, an eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition of the regression coefficients from the 3 dyadic cross-lagged panel models suggests that interdependence exists at the level of the whole group (i.e., therapist–husband–wife) rather than between pairs of individuals within the group (e.g., husband–wife). Further, an interaction involving husband’s RSA suggested that interdependence involving the husband ceased when the husband displayed greater regulatory effort. This combination of statistical methods allows for clearly distinguishing between dyadic therapeutic processes and group-level therapeutic processes.

	abstract = {Incorporation of the arts into the current model of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEAM) may have a profound impact on the future of education. In light of this, we examined a novel technology at the intersection of these disciplines. Specifically, an experiment was conducted using augmented reality to learn a musical instrument, namely the guitar. The Fretlight® guitar system uses LED lights embedded in the fretboard to give direct information to the guitarist as to where to place their fingers. This was compared to a standard scale diagram. Results indicate that the Fretlight® system led to initial significant gains in performance over a control condition using diagrams, but these effects disappeared over the course of 30 trials. Potential benefits of the augmented reality technology are discussed, and future work is outlined to better understand how embodied cognition and augmented reality can increase learning outcomes for playing musical instruments.},

For such teams to be realized, we submit that these robots must be physically embodied, autonomous, intelligent, and interactive. As such, we argue that use of increasingly social robots is essential for shifting the perception of robots as tools to robots as teammates and these robots are the type best suited for cybernetic teams. Building from these concepts, we attempt to articulate and adapt team heuristics from research in human teams to this context. In sum, research and technical efforts in this area are still quite novel and thus warranted to shape the teams of the future.},

However, there is little consensus on what constitutes an ideal moral agent let alone an artificial one. Leveraging a recent account of heroism in humans, the aim of this paper is to provide a prospective framework for conceptualizing, and in turn designing ideal artificial moral agents, namely those that would be considered heroic robots. First, an overview of what it means to be an artificial moral agent is provided. Then, an overview of a recent account of heroism that seeks to define the construct as the dynamic and interactive integration of character strengths (e.g., bravery and integrity) and situational constraints that afford the opportunity for moral behavior (i.e., moral affordances). With this as a foundation, a discussion is provided for what it might mean for a robot to be an ideal moral agent by proposing a dynamic and interactive connectionist model of robotic heroism. Given the limited accounts of robots engaging in moral behavior, a case for extending robotic moral capacities beyond just being a moral agent to the level of heroism is supported by drawing from exemplar situations where robots demonstrate heroism in popular film and fiction.},

In this paper we discuss how the developing field of Social Signal Processing, and assessing social cues to interpret social signals, may help to develop a foundation for robotic social intelligence. We describe a taxonomy to further R\&D in HRI and facilitate natural interactions between humans and robots. This is based upon an interdisciplinary framework developed to integrate: (1) the sensors used for detecting social cues, (2) the parameters for differentiating and classifying differing levels of those cues, and (3) how sets of social cues indicate specific social signals. This is necessarily an iterative process, as technologies improve and social science researchers better understand the complex interactions of vast quantities of social cue combinations. As such, the goal of this paper is to advance a taxonomy of this nature to further stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration in the development of advanced social intelligence that mutually informs areas of robotic perception and intelligence.},

	abstract = {Complex domains require cognitive work for which current approaches to training may be ill-suited. To improve training for cognitive work, Klein and Baxter have proposed Cognitive Transformation Theory (CTT), a learning theory that characterizes sensemaking processes as essential to the development of expertise. The objectives of this research were to compare CTT with the instructional strategies of two expert air traffic control instructors to evaluate the relevance of CTT’s four teaching practices, propose refinements to CTT, and identify potential instructional strategies to serve as guidance for the application of CTT. Data were collected using cognitive task analysis methods, including course observation, artifact examination, and knowledge elicitation with two instructors and seven of their students. Data were coded using categories derived from theory and patterns emergent within the data. Results suggest that many of the instructional strategies used were consistent with the teaching practices of CTT and that learning was aligned with the active sensemaking claims of CTT. An integrated set of instructional strategies and a few refinements to CTT are advanced to further its application to training in complex domains. Although this set of strategies may benefit current training practices, further research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological studies have strongly implicated theta-band activity in human working memory processes. Concurrently, work on spontaneous, non-task-related oscillations has revealed the presence of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) within sub-bands of the ongoing EEG, and has begun to demonstrate their functional signiﬁcance. However, few studies have yet assessed the relation of LRTCs (also called scaling relations) to individual differences in cognitive abilities. The present study addressed the intersection of these two literatures by investigating the relation of narrow-band EEG scaling relations to individual differences in working memory ability, with a particular focus on the theta band. Fifty-four healthy adults completed standardized assessments of working memory and separate recordings of their spontaneous, non-task-related EEG. Scaling relations were quantiﬁed in each of the ﬁve classical EEG frequency bands via the estimation of the Hurst exponent obtained from detrended ﬂuctuation analysis. A multilevel modeling framework was used to characterize the relation of working memory performance to scaling relations as a function of general scalp location in Cartesian space. Overall, results indicated an inverse relationship between both delta and theta scaling relations and working memory ability, which was most prominent at posterior sensors, and was independent of either spatial or individual variability in band-speciﬁc power. These ﬁndings add to the growing literature demonstrating the relevance of neural LRTCs for understanding brain functioning, and support a construct- and state-dependent view of their functional implications.},

Advances in this area are crucial for understanding and exploring the social, cognitive, and neural processes that arise during human interactions with complex sociotechnological systems. Overviews of the major areas of SCAN research, including emotion, theory of mind, and joint action, are provided as the basis for describing three applications of SCAN to human-machine systems research and development. Specifically, this paper provides three examples to demonstrate the broad interdisciplinary applicability of SCAN and the ways it can contribute to improving a number of human-machine systems with the pursuit of further research in this vein. These include applying SCAN to learning and training, informing the field of human-robot interaction (HRI), and, finally, for enhancing team performance. The goal is to draw attention to the insights that can be gained by integrating SCAN with ongoing human-machine system research and to provide guidance to foster collaborations of this nature. Toward this end, we provide a systematic set of notional research questions for each detailed application within the context of the three major emphases of SCAN research. In turn, this study serves as a roadmap for preliminary investigations that integrate SCAN and human-machine system research.},

	abstract = {In this paper we suggest that differing approaches to the science of social cognition mirror the arguments between radical embodied and traditional approaches to cognition. We contrast the use in social cognition of theoretical inference and mental simulation mechanisms with approaches emphasizing a direct perception of others’ mental states. We build from a recent integrative framework unifying these divergent perspectives through the use of dual-process theory and supporting social neuroscience research. Our elaboration considers two complementary notions of direct perception: one primarily stemming from ecological psychology and the other from enactive cognition theory. We use this as the foundation from which to offer an account of the informational basis for social information and assert a set of research propositions to further the science of social cognition. In doing so, we point out how perception of the minds of others can be supported in some cases by lawful information, supporting direct perception of social affordances and perhaps, mental states, and in other cases by cues that support indirect perceptual inference. Our goal is to extend accounts of social cognition by integrating advances across disciplines to provide a multi-level and multi-theoretic description that can advance this field and offer a means through which to reconcile radical embodied and traditional approaches to cognitive neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Musical instruction often includes materials that can act as a barrier to learning. New technologies using augmented reality may aid in reducing the initial difficulties involved in learning music by lowering these barriers characteristic of traditional instructional materials. Therefore, this set of studies examined a novel augmented reality guitar learning system (i.e., the Fretlight® guitar) in regards to current theories of embodied music cognition. Specifically, we examined the effects of using this system in comparison to a standard instructional material (i.e. diagrams). First, we review major theories related to musical embodiment and specify a niche within this research space we call embodied music technology for learning. Following, we explicate two parallel experiments that were conducted to address the learning effects of this system. Experiment 1 examined short-term learning effects within one experimental session, while Experiment 2 examined both short-term and long-term effects across two sessions spaced at a two-week interval. Analyses demonstrated that, for many of our dependent variables, all participants increased in performance across time. Further, the Fretlight® condition consistently led to significantly better outcomes via interactive effects, including significantly better long term retention for the learned information across a two week time interval. These results are discussed in the context of embodied cognition theory as it relates to music. Potential limitations and avenues for future research are described.},

	abstract = {As robots are increasingly deployed in settings requiring social interaction, research is needed to examine the social signals perceived by humans when robots display certain social cues. In this paper, we report a study designed to examine how humans interpret social cues exhibited by robots. We first provide a brief overview of perspectives from social cognition in humans and how these processes are applicable to human-robot interaction (HRI). We then discuss the need to examine the relationship between social cues and signals as a function of the degree to which a robot is perceived as a socially present agent. We describe an experiment in which social cues were manipulated on an iRobot Ava™ Mobile Robotics Platform in a hallway navigation scenario. Cues associated with the robot’s proxemic behavior were found to significantly affect participant perceptions of the robot’s social presence and emotional state while cues associated with the robot’s gaze behavior were not found to be significant. Further, regardless of the proxemic behavior, participants attributed more social presence and emotional states to the robot over repeated interactions than when they first interacted with it. Generally, these results indicate the importance for HRI research to consider how social cues expressed by a robot can differentially affect perceptions of the robot’s mental states and intentions. The discussion focuses on implications for the design of robotic systems and future directions for research on the relationship between social cues and signals.},

Depressed, SII, and control adolescents and their mothers participated (N = 76 dyads). We expected that (a) mothers’ evocative behaviors would affect behavioral and psychophysiological reactivity among depressed and, especially, SII adolescents, (b) adolescents’ behaviors would not evoke mothers’ behavioral or physiological reactivity, and (c) control teens and mothers would be less reactive, with no dynamic associations in either direction. Convergent cross-mapping with dewdrop regression, which identifies directional associations, indicated that mothers’ behaviors evoked behavioral responses among depressed and SII participants, but evoked psychophysiological reactivity for SII teens only. There were no effects of adolescents’ behavior on mothers’ reactivity. Results are interpreted based on sensitivity theories and directions for further research are outlined.},

However, traditional interpretations of the results of these models do not fully or correctly capture the dyadic temporal patterns estimated in RM-APIM. Interpretation of results from these models largely focuses on the meaning of single-parameter estimates in isolation from all the others. However, considering individual coefficients separately impedes the understanding of how these associations combine to produce an interdependent pattern that emerges over time. Additionally, positive within-person, or actor, effects are commonly misinterpreted as indicating growth from one time point to the next when they actually represent decline. We suggest that change-as-outcome RM-APIMs and vector field diagrams (VFDs) can be used to improve the understanding and presentation of dyadic patterns of association described by standard RM-APIMs. The current article briefly reviews the conceptual foundations of RM-APIMs, demonstrates how change-as-outcome RM-APIMs and VFDs can aid interpretation of standard RM-APIMs, and provides a tutorial in making VFDs using multilevel modeling.

	abstract = {During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyadic teams. We used cross-wavelet coherence to examine movement coordination, extracted from videos, at several scales, and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m), was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we observed that coherence at .25s and 1s scales was predictive of performance. However, when including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. Further, we used growth curve modeling to examine how movement coordination changes across the duration of the task and whether this is moderated by CPS performance. We found that coordination over the duration of the CPS task is quadratic (a U shape) and that better performing teams have higher coordination with a shallower curve. We discuss these findings and their relevance to understanding how low-level movement coordination facilitates CPS.},

	abstract = {Multiple theories of problem-solving hypothesize that there are distinct qualitative phases exhibited during effective problem-solving. However, limited research has attempted to identify when transitions between phases occur. We integrate theory on collaborative problem-solving (CPS) with dynamical systems theory suggesting that when a system is undergoing a phase transition it should exhibit a peak in entropy and that entropy levels should also relate to team performance. Communications from 40 teams that collaborated on a complex problem were coded for occurrence of problem-solving processes. We applied a sliding window entropy technique to each team's communications and specified criteria for (a) identifying data points that qualify as peaks and (b) determining which peaks were robust. We used multilevel modeling, and provide a qualitative example, to evaluate whether phases exhibit distinct distributions of communication processes. We also tested whether there was a relationship between entropy values at transition points and CPS performance. We found that a proportion of entropy peaks was robust and that the relative occurrence of communication codes varied significantly across phases. Peaks in entropy thus corresponded to qualitative shifts in teams’ CPS communications, providing empirical evidence that teams exhibit phase transitions during CPS. Also, lower average levels of entropy at the phase transition points predicted better CPS performance. We specify future directions to improve understanding of phase transitions during CPS, and collaborative cognition, more broadly.},

	abstract = {Social interactions are pervasive in human life with varying forms of interpersonal coordination emerging and spanning different modalities (e.g., behaviors, speech/language, and neurophysiology). However, during social interactions, as in any dynamical system, patterns of coordination form and dissipate at different scales. Historically, researchers have used aggregate measures to capture coordination over time. While those measures (e.g., mean relative phase, cross-correlation, coherence) have provided a wealth of information about coordination in social settings, some evidence suggests that multiscale coordination may change over the time course of a typical empirical observation. To address this gap, we demonstrate an underutilized method, windowed multiscale synchrony, that moves beyond quantifying aggregate measures of coordination by focusing on how the relative strength of coordination changes over time and the scales that comprise social interaction. This method involves using a wavelet transform to decompose time series into component frequencies (i.e., scales), preserving temporal information and then quantifying phase synchronization at each of these scales. We apply this method to both simulated and empirical interpersonal physiological and neuromechanical data. We anticipate that demonstrating this method will stimulate new insights on the mechanisms and functions of synchrony in interpersonal contexts using neurophysiological and behavioral measures.},

	abstract = {For effective human-robot interaction, we argue that robots must gain social-cognitive mechanisms that allow them to function naturally and intuitively during social interactions with humans. However, a lack of consensus on social cognitive processes poses a challenge for how to design such mechanisms for artificial cognitive systems. We discuss a recent integrative perspective of social cognition to provide a systematic theoretical underpinning for computational instantiations of these mechanisms. We highlight several commitments of our approach that we refer to as Engineering Human Social Cognition. We then provide a series of recommendations to facilitate the development of the perceptual, motor, and cognitive architecture for this proposed artificial cognitive system in future work. For each recommendation, we highlight their relation to the discussed social-cognitive mechanisms, provide the rationale for these recommendations and potential benefits, and detail examples of associated computational formalisms that could be leveraged to instantiate our recommendations. Overall, the goal of this paper is to outline an interdisciplinary and multi-theoretic approach to facilitate the design of robots that will one day function, and be perceived, as socially interactive and effective teammates.},

	abstract = {In this paper we advance team theory by describing how cognition occurs across the distribution of members and the artifacts and technology that support their efforts. We draw from complementary theorizing coming out of cognitive engineering and cognitive science that views forms of cognition as external and extended and integrate this with theorizing on macrocognition in teams. Two frameworks are described that provide the groundwork for advancing theory and aid in the development of more precise measures for understanding team cognition via focus on artifacts and the technologies supporting their development and use. This includes distinctions between teamwork and taskwork and the notion of general and specific competencies from the organizational sciences along with the concepts of offloading and scaffolding from the cognitive sciences. This paper contributes to the team cognition literature along multiple lines. First, it aids theory development by synthesizing a broad set of perspectives on the varied forms of cognition emerging in complex collaborative contexts. Second, it supports research by providing diagnostic guidelines to study how artifacts are related to team cognition. Finally, it supports information systems designers by more precisely describing how to conceptualize team-supporting technology and artifacts. As such, it provides a means to more richly understand process and performance as it occurs within sociotechnical systems. Our overarching objective is to show how team cognition can both be more clearly conceptualized and more precisely measured by integrating theory from cognitive engineering and the cognitive and organizational sciences.},

	abstract = {During crisis situations, teams are more prone to coordination breakdowns that are characterized by a temporary, diminished ability to function effectively as a team. However, team research currently lacks robust approaches for identifying transitions from effective team functioning to coordination breakdowns. With the current study, we aimed to develop such robust approaches, and to deepen our understanding of how team coordination dynamics across various physiological signals reflect coordination breakdowns. Consequently, we used audiovisual data from four-person teams involved in a stressful collaborative game task to manually identify coordination breakdowns. Next, we set out to computationally identify coordination breakdowns by applying continuous measures of team coordination (windowed synchronization coefficient and multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis) to photoplethysmogram and electrodermal activity data obtained during the task, and identifying transitions therein with change point and nonlinear prediction algorithms. We found that our computational coordination breakdown identification approaches can identify up to 96\% of the manually identified coordination breakdowns although our results also show that the precision of our approaches falls far behind. Our findings contribute theoretically and methodologically to the systematic investigation of coordination breakdowns, which may ultimately facilitate the support of teams in responding to and mitigating negative consequences of crisis situations.},

Following this hypothesis, team researchers have adopted dynamical approaches to better understand the team cognitive processes and states that form team cognition, as well as how they emerge over time. One approach focuses on team coordination dynamics, which examines the coupling of signals between interacting individuals in various modalities, and has been shown to reflect aspects of team functioning including team cognition. However, how changes in team coordination relate to high-level team cognitive processes and states, as well as important events, are not yet fully understood. To this end, we advance a methodological framework for researching team cognition under the dynamical hypothesis. Subsequently, we provided an empirical case-study application of this framework.

	abstract = {Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature–technique combinations, such as fractal dimension–ETE and Tonnetz distance–EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

	abstract = {Neurophysiological measurements, such as electroencephalography (EEG), can be used to derive insight into pilots’ mental states during flight training and to track learning progress in order to optimize the training experience for each individual. Prior work has demonstrated that the level of fidelity of a flight simulation (2D Desktop vs. 3D VR) is associated with different cortical activity in relation to task demands. However, it remains unknown whether simulation fidelity affects flight performance, and whether this effect can be observed in EEG neurophysiological responses associated with workload. The current study therefore assessed whether an EEG-based index of workload and task engagement is predictive of performance during flight training in different simulation environments. We conducted a within-subject designed experiment with 53 novice participants who performed two flight tasks (speed change, medium turn) under two conditions (Desktop vs. VR). EEG signals were collected throughout the experiment to quantify mental workload using the beta-ratio (βα+θ). The VR condition showed increased beta-ratios in all lobes, including frontal and parietal areas, compared to the Desktop simulation. Additionally, we observed an effect of simulator environment on performance, as VR was associated with improved flight performance. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between the beta-ratio and performance. Our findings demonstrate that the brain responds differently to tasks in training environments of various levels of fidelity. However, more research into the neurometrics of flight training is needed in order to develop brain-computer interfaces that can enhance current pilot training methods by providing personalized feedback in real-time.},

	abstract = {Quantifying workload is necessary for effective and personalized flight training of student pilots: their workload must not be too low (risk of boredom) nor too high (overload). Passive brain-computer interfaces (pBCIs) allow for measurement of an individual’s workload from their brain activity, however, the performance of pBCIs remains suboptimal due to individual differences and lack of data for classifier training. In this study, we addressed this problem by combining EEG and behavioral data from six novice military pilots who performed a flight task in Virtual Reality in order to develop calibration-free pBCIs for workload assessment. Three pBCI classifiers were trained on EEG spectral power features from theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands, and an additional behavioral feature derived from pilots’ control inputs on the (joy)stick. The models reached average classification accuracies of 0.82, 0.78, and 0.78. The key feature driving the models’ performance was EEG theta power from several regions of the brain. The pilots’ control inputs (i.e., behavioral feature) did not contribute to the model performance, however, it moderately correlated with several EEG theta power features. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a subject-independent pBCI for calibration-free classification of workload in pilots as well as the importance of theta power at frontal and centro-parietal areas as a metric for real-time monitoring of workload. The use of behavioral control inputs together with fewer but highly predictive EEG features warrants further research.},

In this study, we examine the competitive esport Dota 2 (D2) as a setting to explore within-team implicit coordination, which we model as player avatar movement synchrony. Utilizing the cluster phase method, we analyze spatio-temporal patterns of player movements to quantify implicit movement coordination. We observe a negative linear relationship between team movement synchrony and team performance in rank for D2 competitions across two tournaments. While some research suggests stronger coordination leads to favorable outcomes, we leverage our findings to discuss the complexity of team coordination, showcasing a delicate balance between specialization of individual team members and collective action. This study not only extends complex systems techniques used in physical sports to the rapidly evolving esports arena, but also invites further exploration into the multidimensional nature of coordination in team-based activities.},

This paper explored how training environments (simulated vs. real flight), flight control conditions (student pilot flying vs. monitoring), and flight phases (take-off vs. downwind vs. landing) could affect mental workload in student and instructor pilots, as well as their interpersonal coordination through electrocardiography (ECG) based measures. Student pilots performed four consecutive standard flight traffic patterns with an instructor in a simulator and in real flight, under different flight control conditions of varying workload demands, while their ECG signals were recorded. The results indicated different patterns of interpersonal coordination between simulated and real flight. The other experimental variables, i.e., flight control and flight phase, mostly had an effect on participants’ heart rate and heart rate variability. In accordance with the existing literature, heart rate increased in high workload conditions and flight phases, whilst heart rate variability decreased. Additionally, we observed a linear relationship between subjective workload and physiological synchrony which indicates that student-instructor coordination increased as the student pilot experienced more mental workload in the flight tasks. The current study highlights that individual workload as well as dyadic workload, measured through cardiac signals, can be used to evaluate student-instructor coordination during flight training as an indicator of training outcomes.},

This systematic review examines how biofeedback functions within teams, identifying key design components and their impact on team effectiveness. We propose a framework that structures biofeedback into three phases: physiological data collection, processing, and feedback delivery. Our analysis of 30 empirical studies reveals that biofeedback can improve team processes by promoting balanced communication, enhancing awareness of team dynamics, and facilitating collaboration. Additionally, biofeedback fosters emergent team states such as connectedness, empathy, and social presence, supporting team cohesion. While evidence indicates that biofeedback enhances dyadic team performance, its impact on larger teams remains limited to subjective performance evaluations. The review identifies key research gaps including the limited study of autonomic nervous system activity, insufficient team-level data processing methods, and a narrow focus on visual feedback. We outline practical considerations for designing biofeedback systems that enhance team effectiveness across contexts. Future research should refine biofeedback designs, extend applications beyond the lab, and incorporate interdisciplinary insights to strengthen theoretical models.

	abstract = {Team coordination breakdowns (TCBs) generally reflect episodes of ineffective team functioning, resulting in suboptimal team performance. Computational identification of TCBs enables us to examine the underlying characteristics of suboptimal performance and to potentially deliver real-time feedback to teams. Especially in time-critical crisis situations, such feedback can be invaluable. Previous studies found difficulties in distinguishing between coordination patterns that indicate TCBs and patterns that indicated other aspects of teamwork (e.g., shifts in tasks or affective behavior). Subsequently, we examined features capturing underlying characteristics of team coordination, based on multiple physiological signals and coordination measures, to identify TCBs. Our multi-methodological approach allowed us to identify features that are important for TCB identification. We also observed that distributions of (coordination-based) feature data related and unrelated to TCBs were significantly different, indicating that the features captured underlying patterns in team coordination data. In addition, our results indicated that team performance, measured as goal achievement duration, is more severely compromised when TCBs lasted longer. By showing a relationship between TCBs and goal achievement duration, as well as understanding the key features of these TCBs, our study contributes to deepening our understanding of TCBs and provides a basis for future research pursuing timely team support interventions.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) research has provided overviews of locomotion techniques, how they work, their strengths and overall user experience. Considerable research has investigated new methodologies, particularly machine learning to develop redirection algorithms. To best support the development of redirection algorithms through machine learning, we must understand how best to replicate human navigation and behaviour in VR, which can be supported by the accumulation of results produced through live-user experiments. However, it can be difficult to identify, select and compare relevant research without a pre-existing framework in an ever-growing research field. Therefore, this work aimed to facilitate the ongoing structuring and comparison of the VR-based natural walking literature by providing a standardised framework for researchers to utilise. We applied thematic analysis to study methodology descriptions from 140 VR-based papers that contained live-user experiments. From this analysis, we developed the LoCoMoTe framework with three themes: navigational decisions, technique implementation, and modalities. The LoCoMoTe framework provides a standardised approach to structuring and comparing experimental conditions. The framework should be continually updated to categorise and systematise knowledge and aid in identifying research gaps and discussions.},

This study aims to answer this question by comparing a data-to-text system only supplemented with a language model, to two data-to-text systems that are additionally enriched by a data augmentation or a pseudo-labeling semi-supervised learning approach.Results show that semi-supervised learning results in higher scores on diversity metrics. In terms of output quality, extending the training set of a data-to-text system with a language model using the pseudo-labeling approach did increase text quality scores, but the data augmentation approach yielded similar scores to the system without training set extension. These results indicate that semi-supervised learning approaches can bolster output quality and diversity, even when a language model is also present.},

Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into intra-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload from the EEG signals of 52 participants. Results showed that the mean accuracy of the model incorporating both spectral and connectivity features improved by 28\% compared to the model that solely relied on spectral features. Further research on other connectivity metrics and deep learning models in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the potential of a real-time workload-prediction BCI. This could contribute to the development of an adaptive training system for safety-critical operational environments.},

The combination of environmental and psychosocial factors will negatively impact individual and team cognition, potentially jeopardizing mission success. To provide a richer understanding of the issues surrounding team cognition for future space exploration missions, this paper describes an operational assessment to identify the key team cognition factors most likely to affect problem solving. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit team cognitive and associated factors relevant to long-duration spaceflight missions. Ten NASA employees (e.g., astronauts, mission controllers) were interviewed to provide a more complete and accurate representation of individual and team cognitive demands. Our goal was to explicate critical cognitive processes associated with team effectiveness in space missions and provide guidance on technology and training collaborative problem solving for space missions.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) offers a training environment that promotes increased learning and performance. However, to what extent VR flight simulations offer increased performance compared to less-immersive simulators is not clear, and neither are their underlying cognitive aspects. In a within-subject experiment, we compared fight performance and subjective measures of workload, presence, and engagement in two flight training environments (Desktop and VR) on two flight tasks of equal difficulty (changing speed and performing turns). No differences were observed in the flight performance between these conditions. However, participants reported higher presence and engagement in the VR training environment. Additionally, we found a correlation between subjective workload and flight performance in the Desktop condition, but not in VR. We conclude that VR is promising for basic flight training tasks and encourage future work to explore this further by investigating neurophysiological indices of workload and engagement and establishing relationships between presence, workload, and flight performance.},

Participants performed a two-phase eye tracking task; first a baseline phase with only congruent cartoon events, and subsequently an experimental phase in which the same events were adapted to remain congruent or become incongruent to a theme. Results revealed that participants became quicker in recognizing the congruent cartoon events compared to incongruent in the experimental phase, indicating improved memory for congruent cartoon events. No mean difference in gaze towards congruent versus incongruent events was observed. Surprisingly, a slight bias towards gazing to the left side of the screen in the baseline phase diminished during the experimental phase, indicating that the schema congruency manipulation might affect gaze behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that our schema congruency manipulation affects gaze behavior and memory, but further eye tracking analysis could reveal the dynamic nature of this effect.},

	abstract = {During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should, at least on some scales, play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration outcomes. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyads. We used cross-wavelet coherence as a way to examine the degree to which movement coordination is evident at a variety of scales and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than both the amount expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than expected due to chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m) was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we evaluated whether the degree of coherence at scales less than 2s, and the form of coordination (in terms of relative phase), were predictive of CPS performance. We found that .25s and 1s scales were predictive of performance. When including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. We discuss these findings and detail their relevance for expanding our knowledge on how coordination facilitates CPS.},

Complex problem solving requires members to engage in a number of complicated collaborative processes to generate solutions. This chapter illustrates how the Macrocognition in Teams model, developed to guide research on these processes, can be utilized to propose how intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) could be developed to train collaborative problem solving. Metacognitive prompting, based upon macrocognitive processes, was offered as an intervention to scaffold learning these complex processes. Our objective is to provide a theoretically grounded approach for linking intelligent tutoring research and development with team cognition. In this way, team members are more likely to learn how to identify and integrate relevant knowledge, as well as plan, monitor, and reflect on their problem-solving performance as it evolves. We argue that ITSs that utilize metacognitive prompting that promotes team planning during the preparation stage, team knowledge building during the execution stage, and team reflexivity and team knowledge sharing interventions during the reflection stage can improve collaborative problem solving.},
