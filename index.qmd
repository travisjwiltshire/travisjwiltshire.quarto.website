# Dr. Travis J. Wiltshire

**Associate Professor of Computational Cognitive Science, Tilburg University**

I am an interdisciplinary applied cognitive scientist focusing on understanding high-level cognitive processes (e.g., collaborative problem solving, social cognition) during human interaction with social and technological environments. I primarily study these phenomena from a Complex Dynamical Systems perspective, which is a quantitative approach to characterize how interacting components of a system change and coordinate over time. My research aims to examine multiple scales of analysis (e.g., behavior, cognition, and physiology) to explain the functional coordination of a system's components as they span the boundaries of individuals and technologies in support of collaborative interactions.
